Project Setup and Requirements
This project uses React with TypeScript and Bootstrap for styling. It also includes Redux Toolkit for state management and API calls. Follow the steps below to set up the environment and run the project.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. If not, download and install them from Node.js.

1. Initialize the Project Environment with Node and npm
Install Node.js and npm: If you haven't already, make sure Node.js and npm are installed on your system by running:

bash
Copy code
node -v
npm -v
This will output the version of Node and npm installed.

Create a New Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
mkdir project-name
cd project-name
Initialize npm: Initialize the npm environment within the project directory:

bash
Copy code
npm init -y
2. Install React with TypeScript
Set up React and TypeScript: Run the following command to create a new React app with TypeScript:

bash
Copy code
npx create-react-app . --template typescript
The . specifies that the app should be created in the current directory.

Check if TypeScript is Set Up:

You should now see .ts and .tsx files in your project, such as App.tsx.
The tsconfig.json file should also be present, which configures TypeScript settings for the project.
3. Install Redux Toolkit and React-Redux
Redux Toolkit is used for state management and API calls.

Install Redux Toolkit and React-Redux:

bash
Copy code
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
Set up Redux Toolkit for API Calls:

Create a folder structure for Redux, such as src/store, and initialize your slices and store in this folder.
Create and configure the Redux store in store.ts and define your slices as needed in separate files.
4. Install Bootstrap for Styling
Bootstrap helps with responsive styling and provides pre-designed components.

Install Bootstrap:

bash
Copy code
npm install bootstrap
Add Bootstrap to the Project: In src/index.tsx, import Bootstrap's CSS file to make the styles available globally:

typescript
Copy code
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
5. Run the Project
Start the Development Server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the development server on http://localhost:3000. Open this URL in a browser to view the project.
Additional Configuration (Optional)
React Icons: If you need icons in the project, install react-icons:

bash
Copy code
npm install react-icons
Axios for API Calls: Although Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk can handle async actions, you may want to use Axios for more advanced API configurations:

bash
Copy code
npm install axios
Project Structure (Suggested)
Here's a suggested structure for organizing your files:

graphql
Copy code
project-name/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/       # Reusable UI components
│   ├── features/         # Redux slices and features
│   ├── store/            # Redux store setup
│   ├── App.tsx           # Main app component
│   ├── index.tsx         # App entry point
│   ├── types/            # TypeScript types and interfaces
│   └── services/         # API services (if using Axios)
└── package.json
